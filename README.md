# Pygraphcode

Pygraphcode is a Python-based GUI application designed to create, visualize, and interact with Python scripts, providing a user-friendly environment that helps non-developers and those without programming knowledge to easily create and run automation scripts. This project is developed as a portfolio showcase with future expansion in mind, aimed at making script-based automation more accessible.

## Features

Pygraphcode offers a variety of tools to simplify the creation and customization of Python scripts through a graphical interface:

- **Script Elements**: Create reusable script elements, enabling users to build scripts by combining and reusing these building blocks.
- **Dynamic Variables**: Use input boxes for dynamic variables in scripts, allowing for easy modification of variables directly through the GUI.
- **Save and Share Configurations**: Save configurations in a structured JSON format. This JSON file can be easily shared and imported by other users, enabling them to load custom configurations and elements into their own instances of Pygraphcode.
- **Accessible to Non-Developers**: Designed for users who may not have a programming background but want to automate workflows using simple, script-based processes.

## Documentation

- **Automated Documentation**: Documentation is automatically generated using Doxygen to ensure all project details and code usage are consistently updated and available.

## Code Coverage

- **GitHub Actions for Coverage**: Includes GitHub Actions for automated code coverage reports.
- **Coverage Tools**: Utilizes LCOV and GCOV for accurate coverage metrics.

## GUI Availability

Pygraphcode provides a graphical user interface (GUI) compatible with:

- **Windows**
- **Linux**
- **macOS**
